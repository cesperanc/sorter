# Introduction #
This project has three different components:
  * Sorter - an application to sort data sets using various algorithms like Bubble Sort, Shell Sort, Merge Sort and Quick Sort.
  * UdpTime - a time server on which a Sorter client can connect to get the time for the statistical data
  * ShowStats - a client application that connects to a Sorter application to retrieve the statistical information, to store that information on a file or serve it by HTTP to a web browser that connects to the port where the application is listening.

The project was developed within the course of Advanced Programming at the Computer Engineering degree from [School of Technology and Management](http://www.estg.ipleiria.pt/) of [Polytechnic Institute of Leiria](http://www.ipleiria.pt/).

The applications were written on C code and designed to run on a Linux machine.
